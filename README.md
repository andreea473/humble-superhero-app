## If I had more time

If I had more time, I would improve and explore the following areas:

1. **Database Integration** - Instead of using an in-memory array, I would integrate a real database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to persist superhero data.
2. **User Authentication** - Adding authentication (JWT or OAuth) to allow users to manage their own superheroes securely.
3. **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements** - Improving the UI with better styling, animations, and validation for a smoother experience.
4. **Real-Time Updates** - Implementing WebSockets to reflect changes instantly without refreshing the page.
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Writing more Jest tests for both the backend and frontend to ensure stability and reliability.
6. **Deployment** - Deploying the app using services like Vercel (for frontend) and Render/Heroku (for backend) to make it accessible online.
